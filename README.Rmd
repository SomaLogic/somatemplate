# somatemplate <a href="https://somalogic.github.io/somatemplate"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="138" alt="somatemplate website" /></a>

## Overview

`somatemplate` provides a custom [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html)
template for SomaLogic's R packages. This package is designed to provide a 
cohesive visual identity for packages developed by SomaLogic, and we kindly 
request that you do not use it for your own personal package.

`somatemplate` was inspired primarily by 
[tidytemplate](https://tidytemplate.tidyverse.org/) 
and [rotemplate](https://docs.ropensci.org/rotemplate/).


## Installation

`somatemplate` is not currently available to the public, i.e. it is a 
private/internal GitHub repo. To install the package, it must be cloned
and installed locally:

```{bash clone-repo, eval=FALSE}
git clone git@github.com:SomaLogic/somatemplate.git
```

```{r install-local, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("<filepath to somatemplate>", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

Once made public, `somatemplate` can be installed from GitHub as follows:

```{r eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("SomaLogic/somatemplate")
```


## <a id="usage"></a>Usage

To use `somatemplate` for a `pkgdown` site, ensure that the package 
is installed, and that the `DESCRIPTION` contains the following line:

```{r eval=FALSE}
Config/Needs/website: SomaLogic/somatemplate
```

Then, insert the following code into the pkgdown config file, `_pkgdown.yml` 
(or create a new one, if it doesn't exist already):

```{r eval=FALSE}
template:
  package: somatemplate
  bootstrap: 5
```

If you're updating a previously made pkgdown config file to use `somatemplate`, 
use the following list to enable use of the template:

- Run `usethis::use_pkgdown_github_pages()`
- Update `DESCRIPTION` to include `Config/Needs/website: SomaLogic/somatemplate`, as described in [Usage](#usage) above
- Update `_pkgdown.yml` to reference `somatemplate`, as described above
- Optional: Update the `NEWS.md` file to describe use of `somatemplate`

## Package Structure

This `pkgdown` template appears to be structured like a normal R package, but
differs in a few key ways:

```
--- inst
    |__pkgdown
       |__ _pkgdown.yml    # Configuration YAML file for pkgdown site, including customized sidebar links
       |__templates        # Custom HTML templates that override pkgdown defaults
          |__footer.html
       |__extra.scss       # Extra SCSS code that will be copied into the rendered site
--- R
    |__test-function.R.    # Example R function for template testing purposes only
--- vignettes
    |__test-code.Rmd       # Example vignette for template testing purposes only
    |__test-formatting.Rmd # Example vignette for template testing purposes only
```
